- Why organization structure matters

  - The immediate instinct may be to create an organization for every project or department at your company, leading to many divided groups that function in GitHub as siloes

  - This may seem like a good way to manage permissions and reduce noise, but it‚Äôs not always the ideal strategy

  - In fact, it is detrimental to cross-team collaboration and can result in administrative headaches down the line

  - Instead of creating many organizations and siloing users, we suggest using one or few organizations for shared ownership of repositories and making use of teams to segment users within those organizations -- e.g.: [Google](https://github.com/google); [Microsoft](https://github.com/Microsoft)
